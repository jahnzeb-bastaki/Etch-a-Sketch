# Etch-a-Sketch
Part of the Odin Project, this project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the classic Etch-A-Sketch pad. Here, the user can toggle between 'Classic' or 'Rainbow' Mode. The user can also change the grid size from a 1 x 1 grid size to the maximum grid size of 64 x 64. Overall this project is aimed at showing my skills at DOM manipulation and event manipulation while trying to sprinkle a little bit of creativity.
